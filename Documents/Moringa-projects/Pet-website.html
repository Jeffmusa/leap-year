  <h2>Fun facts about Perry</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Perry loves to play. She is quite acrobatic too â€” especially when you take out a toy fishing pole or a cat dancer toy. She will leap, run, and pounce on the toy, which is great fun to watch.</li>
    <li>Perry loves to be pet, held, and cuddled. Plus, she is extremely loyal. Give her a bit of attention, and you'll get a lot of love in return.</li>
    <li>You can teach Perry to come when called, to not scratch the furniture, and to retrieve a toy. Just like clicker training with dogs, you can teach Perry with a clicker. It's a good idea to purchase a Perry training video or book that you can watch or read together as a family before you get her.</li>
    <li>Perry sometimes don't get the credit she deserve. She is often seen as solitary, aloof creatures. But this can be far from the truth. Perry can thrive in a family with children, and can even learn to play games that are traditionally associated with dogs, such as fetch.</li>
